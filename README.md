# Developing-an-Arabic-Sign-Language-model.-
In this project, I created an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch to predict digits. The training data consisted of 42000
images of handwritten digits, and the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%.
Later, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is better suited for image training, to build a sign language
model. This model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow, using a dataset of 50,000 images representing 32 different Arabic sign
letters and it was able to predict the sign language images with accuracy of 95.9%.
