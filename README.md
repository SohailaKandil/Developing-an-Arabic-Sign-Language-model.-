# Developing-an-Arabic-Sign-Language-model.-
In this project, I created an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch to predict digits. The training data consisted of 42000
images of handwritten digits, and the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%.
Later, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is better suited for image training, to build a sign language
model. This model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow, using a dataset of 50,000 images representing 32 different Arabic sign
letters and it was able to predict the sign language images with accuracy of 95.9%.

## 1. Building a digit recognition neural network from scratch
### 1.1. Digits dataset description
Description: In this project, we built a neural network to pre-
dict digits represented in gray scale images. The dataset con-
sists of 42,000 images stored in an Excel sheet. Each row rep-
resents the pixel values of an image, with a size of 28 by 28
pixels (784 total pixels).
